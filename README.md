# L03.04_Dialogs
Lecture 03 - 04 Dialogs, DISCA - UPV, Development of apps for mobile devices.

After clicking a Button a Dialog is built and shown.
This dialog is created by means of an AlterDialog.Builder, providing a title, icon, message, and two buttons to react to positive and negative actions.
The dialog cannot be cancelled.

Custom dialogs and the definition of interfaces to pass information to/from the Dialog will be discussed when dealing with DialogFragments in L06.01_Fragments.
